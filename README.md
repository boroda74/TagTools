# ADDITIONAL TAGGING & REPORTING TOOLS PLUGIN

# Additional Tagging \& Reporting Tools plugin

Plugin requires MusicBee version **3.5** or higher.

*Note:*

If you are familiar with the plugin quick update process, you can always download *the latest plugin version [here][1]* (NOTE: this latest version always requires the latest version of MusicBee, which sometimes may be available as a beta). Copy all files from the archive “mb_TagTools_latest.zip” to the MusicBee “Plugins” folder, overwriting existing files.

*Note:*

Plugin's advanced features are very sophisticated and can be confusing, though basic ones are pretty simple to use. But you can disable almost any part of plugin functionality (of course, you can re-enable any part later). Disabling any plugin menu item in settings hides not only the menu item itself but also turns off the entire corresponding plugin functionality.

*Note:*

Pay attention to tool tips over buttons/fields in plugin windows. Use help: Tools> Additional Tagging & Reporting Tools> Help.

#### Plugin adding/updating/removing
